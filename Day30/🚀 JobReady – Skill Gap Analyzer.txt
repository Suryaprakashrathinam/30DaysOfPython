🚀 JobReady – Skill Gap Analyzer
👉 Problem: Students often apply for jobs without a clear understanding of the skills required for a role, 
leading to mismatched applications and frustration.

👉 Solution: An app where students can:

Select a career (e.g., Data Analyst, Web Developer, etc.)

View the key skills needed for that career

Rate their current level for each skill

Instantly see their skill gap

Get a personalized learning roadmap

Export the roadmap as a PDF

👉 Target Users:

Final-year students

Freshers

Bootcamp participants

Career switchers

👉 Tech Stack:

Python + Kivy → Cross-platform GUI app

Matplotlib / Plotly → Skill gap bar chart

FPDF / ReportLab → PDF generation

JSON / CSV → Data storage for roles/skills

Optional → FastAPI / Flask for future web integration

🛠 Detailed 3-Part Project Division

🔹 Part 1 – Role & Skill Management + Self-Assessment Input
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

🎯 Handled by Team Member 1

Tasks:
✅ Design and build the Kivy GUI for:

Role selection (dropdown or list)

Display of required skills for that role (with description)

Input sliders or dropdowns for self-rating (e.g., 1 to 5)

✅ Prepare a JSON / CSV file containing:

List of careers (e.g., Data Analyst, Web Developer, Graphic Designer)

Required skills for each career (e.g., Data Analyst → Excel, SQL, Power BI, Python)

✅ Load and parse this file in the app.

Tools:
Kivy → GUI (dropdowns, buttons, input fields)

JSON / CSV → Store role-skill mappings

Deliverable:
A working UI to choose career → view skills → rate yourself

Code to load and display data dynamically

🔹 Part 2 – Skill Gap Analysis + Visualization
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

🎯 Handled by Team Member 2

Tasks:
✅ Create logic to:

Compare self-rating with target rating (e.g., target = 4/5 for Data Analyst Excel skill)

Compute gap per skill

✅ Use Matplotlib / Plotly to generate:

A clear bar chart:

X-axis → Skill names

Y-axis → Skill level (2 bars per skill: Target vs Self-rating)

✅ Embed this chart into the app or show in a pop-up.

Tools:
Python functions → Calculate gaps

Matplotlib / Plotly → Generate bar charts

Deliverable:
Skill gap analysis module

Bar chart visual of gap

🔹 Part 3 – Roadmap Generator + PDF Export
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

🎯 Handled by Team Member 3

Tasks:
✅ Based on gaps:

For each skill with a gap, generate a mini learning plan (e.g., “Excel gap = 2 → Complete Excel Beginner + Intermediate courses”)

✅ Create a clean PDF report:

Header: Student name, chosen role

Table or list: Skill, self-rating, target, gap, learning suggestion

Embed skill gap chart

Date/time

✅ Add “Download PDF” button in Kivy

Tools:
FPDF / ReportLab → Generate PDF

Kivy → Button for export

Deliverable:
Personalized skill roadmap as PDF

PDF includes chart + plan

🌟 Extra Suggestions
Add your team names / credits in the PDF footer

Include date, version number

Add option to reset or analyze another role

Design app layout cleanly: grid or vertical stack (Kivy BoxLayout/GridLayout)
